  #
  # The lifecycle is handled by methods in the Agreement class. Those methods
  # create a new revision with the next state in the lifecycle â€” DO NOT change
  # the state of a specific revision in methods of this class. The possible
  # states are the following:
  #
  # 1. The initial agreement revision of a new agreement is born as "draft".
  #
  # 2. Next it is validated by consumer attorney, a new revision with the
  #   state "validated_draft" (See Agreement#validate_draft) is generated. Note
  #   that the attorney can't send the agreement back to the creator. If any
  #   change is required, it has to edit the agreement himself.
  #
  # 3. Then it is reviewed/signed by consumer undersecretary. Here a new revision
  #   with the state "signed_draft" (See Agreement#sign_draft) is created.
  #   Note that the undersecretary can't edit the agreement. If any change is
  #   required it has to object the agreement...
  #
  # 4. ...In which case a new agreement revision is created with the state
  #   "objected" (See Agreement#object_revision) and should be reviewed again by
  #   the attorney (Back to step 2)
  #
  # 5. Back to the happy path, a "signed_draft" from step 3 is then reviewed by
  #    the attorney of the provider organization. If everything looks OK to him,
  #    a new agreement revision will be created with the "validated" state
  #    (See Agreement#validate_revision). If something DOES NOT look OK to him,
  #    he can also object a revision...
  #
  # 6. ...In which case just like in step 4, a new agreement revision is created
  #    with the state  "objected" (See Agreement#object_revision) and the
  #    objections have to be reviewed by the attorney of the consumer (Back to
  #    step 2).
  #
  # 7. Again on the happy path: A "validated" agreement revision has to be
  #    signed by the provider organization's undersecretary, in which case the
  #    final revision of the agreement will be created with the "signed" state.
  #    (See Agreement#sign). But of course the undersecretary might NOT want to
  #    sign it...
  #
  # 8. ...In which case, a new agreement revision is created sith the
  #    "rejected_sign" state (See Agreement#reject_sign). Note that this is a
  #    different state than "objected" because the *provider*'s attorney has to
  #    look at the comments from his undersecretary and either edit/forward them
  #    to his counterpart (the consumer's attorney) or disagree with those
  #    comments and still recommend the agreement to be signed. In other words,
  #    we are back to step 5.
  #
  # ALWAYS add new states at the end.
